# cs175_Project

For this project my team and I were instructed to create anything that could be sold as a product. We decided that we would create a product called RateYourSkills, which would give employees a way to inform their employer which programming languages they are strongest in and what projects they would like to work on. As a team, we found that employees who were interested and skilled in the project they were working on almost always produced better work.

We created a basic website using python through the use of the Flask libraries, HTML, and CSS. Assuming that you do not have Flask installed on your computer, you cannot run the files. I have attached screenshots below of what the website looks like.
